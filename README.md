# PyBerAnalysis
Analysis on ride-sharing data by city type.

##Overview of the analysis:

This project is an analysis of ride-sharing data comparing the percentage of total fares by city types; Urban, Rural and Suburban. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we have to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

##Results

Below is the summary of data from the analysis;

Urban city type has almost 3 and 10 times more total rides than Suburban and Rural city types respectively with 1625 rides in total and 2405 total drivers. This comes at no surprise due to the relatively higher population density in Urban areas.

Suburban city type had 625 total rides and 490 total drivers significantly less than Urban city type. Regardless, had $19,356.33 in tiotal fares.

Rural areas being the least total rides and total drivers at 125 and 78 respectively is much lower than the other 2 city types and as a result has the highest average fare per ride at $34.62 per ride.

Below is the multi-line graph to illustrate the complete analysis:

##Summary
Based on the analysis of the ride-sharing data provided, here are 3 recommendations to the CEO;
 1. Run an ad campaign to further promote the convenience and benefits of ride-sharing for passengers.
 2. Incentivize people in the rural and Suburban cities with discounts and promotions to foster loyalty and recurring customers
 3. With a saturation of drivers in the Urban city pay drivers more for relatively longer trips
